Portable PHP password hashing framework implemented in Python.

This Python implementation meant to be and exact port of the the original PHP 
version.

PHPass is used by WordPress, bbPress, Vanilla Forums, PivotX and phpBB. This 
Python port will be handy to work with user account data imported from those 
applications (only the portable password hashes though).

The original PHP version: http://www.openwall.com/phpass/
PHP version written by Solar Designer.
